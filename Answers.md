1. What is React JS? How does it differ from other JavaScript frameworks?
    - React is a JS library that allows us to build UI's by handling each piece of the UI as a component. 
    - I believe the biggest difference that stands out to me is the ability to use JSX allowing the user to use HTML syntax to render subcomponents 


2. Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. Name three of the methods that are a part of the lifecycle and what they do.
    - RCL is each section of the UI when rendering, updating, rerendering, and disappering entirely.
    - componetWillMount - starts the lifecycle
    - componentWillUnmount - updates the DOM with prop or state change 
    - componentDidMount - loads the data for your component 

3. Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
    - Class/Stateful components call the the state and makes changes to it 
    - Functional/Presentational components recieve data via props and are written as functional components
